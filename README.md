# Province of British Columbia Application Inventory (BCGOV-APPINV)

This document describes BCGOV-APPINV, a simple web-based database application that
empowers an organization to track and manage applications that they are
developing, tracking details for each such as its product title, start
date, and names of people in various roles; it supports listing, viewing,
adding, editing, and removing product records.

BCGOV-APPINV is implemented as a pair of applications named BCGOV-APPINV-DBMS and
BCGOV-APPINV-WEBAPP, such that the latter is what end users typically interact
with directly using a generic web browser, and the former is a supporting
service providing a RESTful API that the latter consumes.

## Contents

This document consists of multiple parts:

1. BCGOV-APPINV - Overview (the current part)
1. [BCGOV-APPINV - End User Manual](docs/Manual.md)
1. [BCGOV-APPINV - Structure](docs/Structure.md)
1. [BCGOV-APPINV - Local Deployment and Testing](docs/Local.md)
1. [BCGOV-APPINV - Assumptions](docs/Assumptions.md)

The [BCGOV-APPINV - End User Manual](docs/Manual.md) part is what regular end
users, who are simply using an already deployed instance of BCGOV-APPINV, need to
know; the other documentation parts are mainly for someone wanting to
deploy or develop the application or otherwise learn more about how it
works internally.
